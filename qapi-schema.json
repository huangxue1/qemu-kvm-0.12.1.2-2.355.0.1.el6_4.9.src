#
# @format: #optional the format of the new image, default is to probe the

#
# @witness: A file descriptor name that was passed via getfd.  QEMU will write

# @dump-guest-memory
#
# Dump guest's memory to vmcore. It is a synchronous operation that can take
# very long depending on the amount of guest memory. This command is only
# supported on i386 and x86_64.
#
# @paging: if true, do paging to get guest's memory mapping. This allows
#          using gdb to process the core file.
#
#          IMPORTANT: this option can make QEMU allocate several gigabytes
#                     of RAM. This can happen for a large guest, or a
#                     malicious guest pretending to be large.
#
#          Also, paging=true has the following limitations:
#
#             1. The guest may be in a catastrophic state or can have corrupted
#                memory, which cannot be trusted
#             2. The guest can be in real-mode even if paging is enabled. For
#                example, the guest uses ACPI to sleep, and ACPI sleep state
#                goes in real-mode
#
# @protocol: the filename or file descriptor of the vmcore. The supported
#            protocols are:
#
#            1. file: the protocol starts with "file:", and the following
#               string is the file's path.
#            2. fd: the protocol starts with "fd:", and the following string
#               is the fd's name.
#
# @begin: #optional if specified, the starting physical address.
#
# @length: #optional if specified, the memory size, in bytes. If you don't
#          want to dump all guest's memory, please specify the start @begin
#          and @length
#
# Returns: nothing on success
#          If @begin contains an invalid address, InvalidParameter
#          If only one of @begin and @length is specified, MissingParameter
#          If @protocol stats with "fd:", and the fd cannot be found, FdNotFound
#          If @protocol starts with "file:", and the file cannot be
#             opened, OpenFileFailed
#          If @protocol does not start with "fd:" or "file:", InvalidParameter
#          If an I/O error occurs while writing the file, IOError
#          If the target does not support this command, Unsupported
